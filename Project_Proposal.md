# Project Proposal

## Name: Janken-Smackdown
Working title, might remove dash. Will require many meetings and likely millions of dollars in research to determine the impact of removal of '-'.

## Description
In the post-apocalyptic world of 2017, in order to survive humanity must fight for survival. In the great arena, the game known as Janken-Smackdown is played. Only one person leaves, but they receive a greatest of all rewards(to be decided) in this hellish world. The game itself pits the remains of humanity against each other in spectacular duels to the death. Using the ancient fighting style of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Random.

---
## How to win:
The player wins the game by defeating every opponent and claiming the end prize. Opponents are defeated in individual battles of rock-paper-scissors-random(RPSR).

---
## How to lose:
The player is defeated in one of the RPSR battles. They can be defeated in battle by losing health from incorrect attack choices, how much health is to be decided(probably decided on a whim while coding).

---
## How player Interacts:
The player will move to new opponents in between battles using WASD or arrow keys. During battle the player can select actions with similar input and using 'enter' or 'space' to finalize their decision. The player also interacts with the eyes and mind, as the only reason to bother playing this game is for the bad 'humor'.
